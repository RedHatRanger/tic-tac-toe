# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a tic-tac-toe python script to show the ideal outcome of a given set with X starting in its optimal move, the CORNER.


## What this code does:
- Each move prints the turn number and shows who played and where.
- Before deciding on a move with minimax, both X and O check for immediate threats (either to win or to block).
- If a threat is found, they immediately take that move.
- If no threat is found, they revert to the minimax strategy to pick the best possible move.
